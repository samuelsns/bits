                    <h2>Introduction to DevOps Culture</h2>
                    <p>DevOps is not just about tools and processes; it's fundamentally about culture and mindset. The technical practices we've covered throughout this course are enabled by and dependent on a supportive organizational culture.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Three Ways of DevOps</h3>
                    <p>Gene Kim's "Three Ways" provide a framework for understanding the core principles of DevOps culture:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The First Way: Flow</strong> - Optimize the flow of work from development to operations to customers</li>
                        <li><strong>The Second Way: Feedback</strong> - Create short feedback loops to detect and address problems quickly</li>
                        <li><strong>The Third Way: Continuous Learning</strong> - Foster a culture of experimentation, learning, and improvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>CALMS Framework</h3>
                    <p>The CALMS framework outlines the key aspects of DevOps culture:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Culture</strong> - Collaborative, open, focused on learning and improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Automation</strong> - Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and reliability</li>
                        <li><strong>Lean</strong> - Eliminating waste and optimizing the value stream</li>
                        <li><strong>Measurement</strong> - Data-driven decision making and continuous improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing</strong> - Knowledge sharing, transparency, and collaboration</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Core Values of DevOps Culture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Breaking down silos between teams</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong> - "You build it, you run it" mentality</li>

                        <h4 class="activity-title">Discussion Question</h4>
                        <p>How does DevOps culture differ from traditional IT culture? What specific cultural changes are needed to support DevOps practices?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Collaboration and Shared Responsibility</h2>
                    <p>Collaboration and shared responsibility are at the heart of DevOps culture.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Breaking Down Silos</h3>
                    <p>Traditional organizations often have silos between development, operations, security, and other teams. DevOps aims to break down these silos through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cross-functional Teams</strong> - Teams with diverse skills and responsibilities</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Shared Responsibility Models</h3>
                    <p>DevOps promotes shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"You Build It, You Run It"</strong> - Teams responsible for both development and operations</li>
                        <li><strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)</strong> - Applying software engineering to operations</li>
                        <li><strong>DevSecOps</strong> - Integrating security throughout the development process</li>
                        <li><strong>Platform Teams</strong> - Providing self-service platforms for development teams</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Communication Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Effective communication is essential for collaboration:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transparent Communication</strong> - Open, honest, and clear communication</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Synchronization</strong> - Stand-ups, reviews, and planning sessions</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Shared knowledge base and documentation</li>
                        <li><strong>Chat and Collaboration Tools</strong> - Real-time communication channels</li>
                        <li><strong>Visualization</strong> - Visual management of work and progress</li>
                    </ul>
